            Born and raised in bygone Bay Area orchards, I've traveled far and seen much. After graduating from UC Davis in 2008, I joined a tech start-up that sent me to Beijing to train customer service. I loved it and joined the Peace Corps, completing service in Lesotho in 2014.</p>
        
            <br><p>Since returning from Africa, I was a teacher for 4 years at various schools, and now I'm a coding trainee. I like video games, board games, hiking, reading, and cats.</p>
            <br><p>Unlike some other armies which have versatile units, the Eldar have many specialists and few which can handle many roles. For example, the Eldar Howling Banshees are melee specialists and, with their power weapons and other special rules, excel at killing heavily armored infantry units in melee combat, while using them for ranged attacks often leads to failure. In contrast, the Eldar Dark Reaper excels at long range fighting but will almost certainly be taken down in melee by even moderately skilled/equipped melee units. However, Dire Avengers can be outfitted for either melee or ranged combat, though they will not be as able as a more specialized aspect.</p>
